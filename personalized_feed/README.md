## Personalized Feed Microservice

The Personalized Feed Microservice is a tag-based recommendation service. It acts as a communication bridge that takes a unique User ID, identifies that user's specific interest tags from a JSON, and filters a collection of generic items. It returns only the items that share at least one matching tag with the user. 
### How to Programmatically REQUEST Data
To get a personalized feed, send a GET request to /recommendations with the userId at the end of the URL.

**Note:** To search for a different user, simply pass a different ID to the function. The microservice will automatically look up the new ID in the database.

### How to Programmatically RECEIVE Data
The microservice returns data as a JSON Array. You must parse the response body to access the list of recommended items.
